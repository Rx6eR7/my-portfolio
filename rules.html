          <h2>Here are the server rules:</h2>
          <p>🌍 Welcome to the Server!
            Before you dive into our blocky world, read these rules. Breaking them might result in banishment to the Shadow Realm (a.k.a. the ban list).
            
            ⚔️ 1. Respect the Players, Not Just the Pixels
            Treat everyone like a teammate—even if you’re in a PvP duel. Harassment, hate speech, bullying, or toxicity of any kind will get you kicked faster than you can say “creeper behind you!”
            
            🛠️ 2. No Hacks, No Cheats, No Shenanigans
            X-ray, fly hacks, autoclickers? Not here, chief. This is a fair SMP—if you didn’t earn it, you don’t keep it.
            
            🔥 3. Keep the World Clean
            No lag machines, endless TNT chains, or redstone spaghetti. Respect the server and everyone’s FPS.
            
            🧾 4. Follow Staff Instructions
            Admins and mods are here to help, not hurt. If they ask you to chill, listen. If you think something’s unfair, DM calmly.
            
            🧠 5. Use Common Sense
            If you have to ask, “Is this allowed?”—it probably isn’t. When in doubt, ask staff before doing something risky.
            
            💬 6. Have Fun, Make Friends, Build Legends
            Seriously. This world is what you make it—so grab your tools, team up, and let’s create something epic</p>
